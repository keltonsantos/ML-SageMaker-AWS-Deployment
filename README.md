# ML-SageMaker-AWS-Deployment
Deploy and monitor a machine learning workflow for Image Classification on Sagemaker - AWS
This repository contains the code and documentation for my project as part of the Machine Learning Nanodegree program by Udacity, in collaboration with AWS.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on deploying machine learning models using AWS SageMaker. The objective is to create a robust, scalable, and efficient system for training and deploying machine learning models.

In this project, we used AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. we deployed our model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose our model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project.

## Project Steps Overview

 - Step 1: Data staging
 - Step 2: Model training and deployment
 - Step 3: Lambdas and step function workflow
 - Step 4: Testing and evaluation
 - Step 5: Optional challenge
 - Step 6: Cleanup cloud resources
